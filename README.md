# ARMinor-2020-Opensource-Virtual-Learning-Environment-AROVLE


This repository includes the tutorial files and ROS packages created as a part of the opensource virtual learning envrironment project at fontys university - adaptive robotics minor.

The project aims to make a set of tutorials for the simulation of robotics in ROS, that can be utilised through a cloud-based computing platform which will allow students and robotics enthusiasts around the world with limited hardware to run their simulations and start their journy in the robotics field.

Tutorials list:

* Introduction to ubuntu: 
a quick tour over ubuntu OS, basic commands and shortcuts.

* Introduction to ROS: 
installation and ROS environment configuration, basic ROS commands, and most used packages.

* Introduction to Gazebo: 
a tour of ROS's simulation envronment.

* Modeling a simple Robot: 
Creating a robot description package of a 2 link manipulator, demonstrates URDF and launch files.

* Creating a Heterogeneous robot: 
using a solidworks generated robot description package, Gazebo plugins, Gazebo world files, visualizing data in Rviz.

* Mapping: 
creating a mapping package and mapping the environment with slam-gmapping, using the robot created in previous tutorials.

* Navigation: 
introduction to ROS navigation stack, global and local planners, configuration files, launch files, and tunning the planners parameters.

* ROS control: 
understing ROS control & gazebo transmissions, gazebo Ros_control plugin, creating a ROS control package which will be used in the future tutorials    with moveit.

* Manipulator control using moveit: 
graphical motion planning using moveit, the setup assistant, moveit and gazebo integration.

* Cartesian path planning in moveit: 
the use of RvizVisulTools, and MoveGroupInterface Api in c++. 

* Matlab and ROS integration: 
integrate a matlab generated code for a motor pid controller with ROS, using a simple two link robot for visualization in Rviz.
